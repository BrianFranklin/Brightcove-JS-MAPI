=====

This project provides a starting point for integrating the Brightcove Media
API into your application. It provides simple ways to interact with the
API.

Compatibility Notice
====================

Please note that the JavaScript MAPI Wrapper v1.0 is **not** compatible with any
previous versions (when it was known as "Kudos"). The class name has been
changed, numerous functions have been re-named, and methods have been
updated to take advantage of Brightcove API changes.

If you need assistance in determining what changes have been made, please
send an e-mail to opensource@brightcove.com with your request.
